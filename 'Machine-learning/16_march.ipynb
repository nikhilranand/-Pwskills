    "Reducing overfitting is essential to ensure that a machine learning model generalizes well to new, unseen data. Here are several techniques to help mitigate overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **More Data**: Increasing the size of the training dataset provides the model with a broader range of examples, making it harder for the model to overfit to noise.\n",

It adds a form of bias to the learning process, helping to strike a balance between fitting the training data well and generalizing to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Regularization Techniques**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**:\n",
    "   L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute values of the model's coefficients. It encourages sparsity in the model, meaning some coefficients become exactly zero, effectively leading to feature selection.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   How it works:\n",
    "   - Larger coefficients are penalized more.\n",
    "   - Some coefficients are shrunk to zero, effectively removing features from the model.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**:\n",
    "   L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the squares of the model's coefficients. It encourages coefficients to be small and spread out, preventing any single coefficient from becoming too large.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   How it works:\n",
    "   - All coefficients are penalized, but none are exactly set to zero.\n",
    "   - Coefficients are evenly distributed and minimized.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Elastic Net Regularization**:\n",
    "   Elastic Net is a combination of L1 and L2 regularization. It adds both L1 and L2 penalties to the model, providing a balance between feature selection (L1) and coefficient balancing (L2).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   How it works:\n",
    "   - Combines the strengths of L1 and L2 regularization.\n",
    "   - Encourages a mix of small coefficients and some exact zeros.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Dropout (Neural Networks)**:\n",
    "   Dropout is a technique used in neural networks during training. It randomly deactivates a portion of neurons in each training iteration. This prevents any single neuron from becoming overly specialized and encourages the network to be more robust.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   How it works:\n",
    "   - Neurons are randomly deactivated with a certain probability during each iteration.\n",
    "   - Forces the network to rely on different subsets of neurons for each input.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Early Stopping**:\n",
    "   Early stopping is not a traditional regularization technique, but it helps prevent overfitting. It involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training and stopping training when the validation performance starts to degrade.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   How it works:\n",
    "   - Prevents the model from fitting noise and overfitting as training progresses.\n",
    "   - Uses the validation set to determine when to stop training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization techniques control model complexity, discourage extreme parameter values, and encourage simpler solutions. They help prevent overfitting by ensuring that the model doesn't memorize the training data but rather captures the essential underlying patterns. The choice of regularization technique depends on the problem, the nature of the data, and the model architecture being used."
